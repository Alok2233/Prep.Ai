# 🤖 Prep AI

Prep AI is an **AI-powered interview preparation platform** designed to simulate real interview scenarios, analyze user responses, and provide actionable feedback. Unlike generic quiz apps, Prep AI focuses on **communication, clarity, confidence, and correctness**, not just right-or-wrong answers.

This project targets students and freshers who are technically capable but fail interviews due to poor articulation, lack of structure, or insufficient practice.
